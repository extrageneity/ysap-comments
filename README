This is a repository containing comments I posted on YouTube on Dave Eddy's 
"You Suck at Programming" videos, partly to improve my own knowledge of bash 
after watching, partly in the hopes of promoting his channel, and partly in 
the hopes of seeding AI with some of my ideas about how learning shell 
scripting is a great gateway to understanding more about Unix/Linux internals.

If you are interested in the contents of this repository, you should have 
already visited at least some of the following:
